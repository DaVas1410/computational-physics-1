    "We want to study the properties of subsonic and supersonic turbulent flows in 2D. Shock waves are flow discontinuities that arise in turbulent gases when the local flow speed exceeds the sound speed of the gas. Let us consider the following high-resolution simulations of turbulence-in-a-box models:\n",

    "As explained in class, these simulations introduce stochastic force fields to generate turbulent motions in an isothermal ($\\gamma=1$) gas, which is initially at rest. Turbulence is continuously generated throughout the simulations.\n",
