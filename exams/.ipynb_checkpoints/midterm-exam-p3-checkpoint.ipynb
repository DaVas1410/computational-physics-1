    "## Part 3. (12 points) Data analysis and visualisation (Orszag-Tang MHD vortex)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Orszag-Tang vortex** system describes a doubly periodic ideal gas configuration leading to 2D supersonic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence. Although an analytical solution is not known, its simple and reproducible set of initial conditions has made it very appealing for the comparison of MHD numerical solvers. The computational domain is a **periodic box** with dimensions: $[0,2\\pi]^2$, and the gas has an adiabatic index $\\gamma=\\frac{5}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code units, the initial conditions are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\vec{v}_{code} = \\left(-\\sin y,\\, \\sin x\\right) \\,,\\qquad\n",
    "\\vec{B}_{code} = \\left(-\\sin y,\\, \\sin 2x\\right) \\,,\\qquad\n",

    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a single python notebook, carry out the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a python function that reads the **units.out** file, stores the normalisation values for length, velocity, and density, calculates the normalisation values for thermal pressure, magnetic field, and time, and returns them all into tuple objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "As shown in class, the normalisation values for thermal pressure ($p_0=\\rho_0\\,v_0^2$), magnetic field ($B_0=\\sqrt{4\\,\\pi\\,\\rho_0\\,v_0^2}$), and time ($t_0=\\frac{L_0}{v_0}$) can be derived from the length, velocity, and density values.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create a python function that reads the **vtk.out** file, reads the second column, and returns the times in CGS units using $t_0$ from point (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create a python function that reads a VTK data file, normalises the data fields to CGS units using the values from points (a) and (b), and returns them jointly with the mesh and time information as tuple objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "(dx2) Call all the above functions for VTK file # 30 of each simulation, and make the following maps using the correct mesh coordinates, dimensions and time, all in in CGS units:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing the gas density, $\\rho$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing the gas sound speed, $c_s=\\sqrt{\\gamma\\frac{p}{\\rho}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing showing the kinetic energy density, $E_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\,v^2$ with $v=\\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A figure showing the magnetic vector field, $\\vec{B}= \\vec{B}_x + \\vec{B}_y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** Choose different perceptually-uniform colour schemes for each of the above quantities, and fix the colour bar limits. Add the correct time stamp in CGS units to each map. Since these are high-resolution models, one way to improve the visualisation of 2D vector fields is to interpolate them into a coarser grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Create a set of Python functions that loops over all the VTK simulation files and returns maps of the density field $\\rho$, the kinetic energy density $E_k$, and also histograms of the density field in CGS units for all times, into a folder called \"output_data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Briefly describe: what happens with the density field as time progresses? Does the density field follow any statistical distribution at late times?\n",
    "\n",
    "(gx2) Create a set of Python functions that loops over all the VTK simulation files, computes the following quantities in CGS units for each time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average gas temperature, $\\overline T$, (**Hint:** the temperature in each grid cell can be calculated using the equation of state for ideal gases, i.e., $p=\\frac{\\rho k_B\\,T}{\\mu m_u}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit, and $\\mu=0.6$ is the mean particle mass in the gas.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average kinetic energy density, $\\overline E_k$, where $E_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\,v^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the average magnetic energy density, $\\overline E_m$, where $E_m = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{B^2}{\\,\\mu_0}$, where $\\mu_0\\equiv$ magnetic permeability of free space.\n",
    "\n",
    "and returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a CSV file with 4 columns, time on the first column, and the above quantities in the next ones. The CSV file should be named \"stats.csv\" saved into the folder called \"output_data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) Create a Python function that reads in the CSV file created in (g) and returns (i.e. shows or saves) high-quality labeled figures of each of the above-computed quantities versus time, into the folder called \"output_data\". \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Briefly describe: Does the flow reach steady state? Which energy density is dominant?\n",
    "\n",
    "(j) Create a Python function that returns movies showing the time evolution of the kinetic energy density maps computed in (d) and their average values calculated in (g). The movies should be saved into the folder called \"output_data\". \n"
